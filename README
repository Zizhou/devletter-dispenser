Easily enter and dispense codes

Current version interacts with devletter-display app for keeping track of "tickets" on a user's profile for the self-service automatic dispenser.

Might add:
-option to create code "bundles" (batch retrieval)
-track which users get which which codes(probably not, requires that *other* DB)







who am I writing this for, anyways?
