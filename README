Easily enter and dispense codes


Current version interacts with devletter-display app for keeping track of "tickets" on a user's profile for the self-service automatic dispenser.

Might add:
-option to create code "bundles" (batch retrieval)
-track which users get which which codes(probably not, requires that *other* DB)




Setup notes:
remember to create one(1) Settings object with global_url and donation_id because I am bad at programming





who am I writing this for, anyways?
